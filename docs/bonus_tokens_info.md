# Zenith - Bonus Tokens Information

## Distribution of 16 Bonus Tokens

### Setup Distribution:

**8 tokens placed on the board initially:**
- **5 bonus tokens** on the Planet board (one on each of the 5 planet influence tracks)
  - Mercury (purple)
  - Venus (orange)
  - Terra (blue)
  - Mars (red)
  - Jupiter (green)
- **3 bonus tokens** on the Technology board (one on each of the 3 technology faction spaces)
  - Animod
  - Human
  - Robot

**8 tokens remaining:**
- **8 bonus tokens** in the supply/deck that can be drawn during gameplay

### How Bonus Tokens Work:

1. During setup, one random, face-up bonus token is placed on each of the 5 planet spaces and each of the 3 technology board spaces
2. When a player gains an Influence disc (moves it to their control zone), they immediately apply the effect of the bonus token from that planet's track, then discard it
3. When a player is the first to reach Level 2 on any technology track, they gain a bonus token from the supply
4. Various card effects can also award bonus tokens from the supply
5. When the supply runs out, discarded bonuses are reshuffled back into the supply

- After use, bonus tokens are discarded to a discard pile
- When the supply is empty and a bonus token needs to be drawn, the discard pile is reshuffled
- Some bonus effects may offer choices (e.g., "Gain 1 Zenithium OR gain 7 Credits")
- Bonus #16 allows strategic theft of bonus tokens from the board before other players can claim them
